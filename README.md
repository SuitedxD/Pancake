# Official Pancake Documentation
Welcome! In this repository, you'll find everything about Pancake: a multifunctional Discord bot designed by and for our community.

## How does Pancake work?
Pancake works through a **simple modular plugin system**. Plugins are an exclusive feature of Pancake that allow you to **load and execute packages of slash commands** in your Discord server. Once installed, these slash commands will be visible and usable only by you and the members of your server.

## Advantages of Pancake and its plugin system:
On paper, this might sound a bit complex or difficult to use, but in practice, **it's very easy and straightforward to understand**. Pancake isn't just made for programmers; it's designed **for all types of Discord users**: from those simply looking for fun commands, to those in need of solid moderation for their server, or even both at the same time! That's the advantage of Pancake: thanks to its plugin system, **you can turn it into any kind of bot your server needs**, all in one.

## How to use it?
The first step is to **add Pancake to your Discord server** by [clicking here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1398868186216271962&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=applications.commands+bot). Then, simply **run `/help-plugins` to get a basic guide on how to install, uninstall, and manage your plugins**.

## Best of all is:
**You can also create your own plugins** as long as they follow our guidelines and are made for the benefit of our entire community. For more information, we invite you to [read our full article about plugins](docs/plugins-guide.md).

***It's time to bring your ideas to life.***
