# Pancake - Privacy Policy
## Version 1.0 — Effective Date: August 17, 2025 — Last Update: August 19, 2025 

Copyright (c) 2025 Pancake Development Team

### Preamble
This Privacy Policy explains what information Pancake collects, how that information is used, shared and stored, and the rights you may have with respect to such information. Pancake operates as a Discord bot and in order to provide its features it necessarily processes certain information described below. By inviting or using Pancake you consent to the processing described in this Policy.

## 1. Scope and Controller
**1.1** Controller: The Pancake Development Team acts as the data controller for personal data processed in connection with the Service, except for data processed exclusively by third-party plugins in which case the Plugin Author may be the controller for plugin-collected data. Contact: pancakebot.team@gmail.com.  
**1.2** Scope: This Policy applies to data collected directly by Pancake core and to data processed for or on behalf of servers that use Pancake, excluding third-party plugin processing which is subject to the plugin author's policies.

## 2. Data We Collect
Pancake may collect the following categories of data depending on enabled features and plugins:

**2.1 Discord identifiers & metadata**  
- Discord user IDs, server (guild) IDs, public username and discriminator, and avatar references.  
- Roles, permissions and membership metadata where relevant to feature operation.  
- Event timestamps (message times, moderation actions).

**2.2 Content processed by the bot**  
- Messages, message fragments or attachments processed for moderation or command execution (for example, deleted messages used as evidence).  
- URLs and links to images or media provided by users (for moderation, evidence, or upload features).  
- Moderation records (warnings, strikes, mutes, bans) when such features are enabled.

**2.3 Configuration and usage data**  
- Server and user configuration settings (prefixes, log channels, module toggles).  
- Telemetry and aggregated usage metrics (e.g., feature usage counts) which are anonymized where practical.

**2.4 Support and optional data**  
- Information you optionally provide through support requests (emails, screenshots, descriptions).  
- Contribution metadata when you submit code, documentation or bug reports.

- **IMPORTANT NOTES:** 
Pancake does not collect Discord passwords or (by default) client IP addresses. If future features require additional data, such requirements will be communicated and consent will be obtained where required by law.

Pancake may process certain user data (such as IDs, usernames, avatars, roles or event medatada) even if you do not directly interact with the bot. This occurs automatically as part of server membership and is necessary for features such as greetings, moderation, logging, or role/permission handling. Such processing is based on legitimate interest in providing the service to the server that has enabled Pancake.

## 3. Purposes of Processing and Legal Bases
Pancake processes data for the following purposes and legal bases:

**3.1** To provide core Service functionality (contractual necessity / legitimate interest).  
**3.2** To maintain security and prevent abuse (legitimate interest).  
**3.3** To provide support and respond to incidents (contractual necessity / legitimate interest).  
**3.4** To analyze usage and improve features via aggregated metrics (legitimate interest).  
**3.5** To comply with legal obligations or respond to lawful requests (compliance with legal obligations).

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties
**4.1 Plugins & Plugin Authors**: Plugins may process additional data. Plugin Authors are independently responsible for their plugin's collection and processing practices. Enabling a plugin constitutes consent to the plugin's data practices.  
**4.2 Service providers**: Pancake may store or process data via third-party hosting and service providers (e.g., Railway, database hosts, backups). These providers act as processors and are bound by their own terms and security measures.  
**4.3 Legal requests**: Pancake may disclose data to comply with laws, subpoenas, or law-enforcement requests.  
**4.4 Transfers**: Data may be stored or processed in jurisdictions other than the user's. Reasonable safeguards will be used where feasible.

## 5. Data Retention
**5.1** Retention is governed by feature configuration and server settings. For server logs and moderation records the default retention period is **90 days**, unless server administrators configure a different retention period or plugins define other retention policies.  
**5.2** Support and backup data may be retained longer where necessary for troubleshooting, legal compliance or fraud prevention.  
**5.3** Upon valid deletion requests Pancake will delete user data insofar as reasonably possible, subject to technical limitations and legal obligations.

## 6. Security Measures
**6.1** Reasonable technical and organizational measures are implemented to protect data (access controls, encrypted transport, rotated credentials).  
**6.2** No system is perfectly secure. Pancake cannot guarantee absolute security and is not liable for unauthorized access beyond its reasonable control. Where feasible, the Team will notify affected parties and take remediation steps following a confirmed security incident.

## 7. Vulnerability Reporting and Incident Response
**7.1** If you discover a security issue, please report it promptly to **pancakebot.team@gmail.com**. Include reproduction steps and a suggested contact method.  
**7.2** The Pancake Development Team will make reasonable efforts to acknowledge reports and to remediate confirmed issues. Notification timelines and remedial measures depend on issue severity and operational constraints.

## 8. User Rights and Requests
Depending on your jurisdiction you may have rights including:  
**8.1** Access to personal data held about you.  
**8.2** Rectification of inaccurate data.  
**8.3** Deletion requests (subject to exceptions such as legal retention obligations).  
**8.4** Objection to or restriction of processing in certain cases.  
**8.5** Data portability where applicable.

To exercise rights, contact pancakebot.team@gmail.com or use official support channels. Reasonable verification may be required.

## 9. Minors
Pancake is not intended for children under the age required by applicable law. If you believe a minor's personal data has been processed without appropriate consent, contact pancakebot.team@gmail.com to request removal.

## 10. Abandonment and Transfer of Control (Privacy Considerations)
**10.1** If the Pancake Development Team intends to discontinue the Service or transfer operational control, the Team will attempt to provide notice and, where practical, to transfer data to the successor with appropriate safeguards or to securely decommission hosted instances.  
**10.2** If an individual leaves the Team, that individual's access to systems and data will be revoked and governance documentation will reflect the change. After formal removal, the departing individual will no longer be considered a controller or processor for future incidents.  
**10.3** Failure to perform an orderly transfer or decommissioning that results in exposed data may be treated as negligent operation by responsible maintainers and may result in enforcement actions by the Team or other stakeholders.

## 11. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. Updated versions will be posted in the official repository with a revised Effective Date. Continued use after posting constitutes acceptance.
