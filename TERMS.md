# Pancake - Terms of Service
## Version 1.0 — Effective Date: August 17, 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 Pancake Development Team

### Preamble
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern access to and use of the Pancake Discord bot, its core code, related services, and official distributions (collectively, the "Service"). By inviting, installing, configuring, or using Pancake on any Discord server, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use Pancake.

## 1. Definitions
**1.1** "Pancake" — the Discord bot, its core codebase, official releases and associated services.  
**1.2** "Pancake Development Team" — the legal/operational entity and recognized team members responsible for development, maintenance and governance of Pancake. New members may be added and recorded pursuant to team governance.  
**1.3** "Authorized Team Member" — a person formally recognized as a current member of the Pancake Development Team and authorized to act on behalf of the team within the scope defined by governance.  
**1.4** "Plugin Author(s)" — authors of third-party plugins or extensions created for Pancake.  
**1.5** "User" — any individual who interacts with Pancake, including server owners, administrators and members.  
**1.6** "Server" — a Discord guild where Pancake is invited.  
**1.7** "Contribution" — code, documentation, assets, or other materials submitted to Pancake's official channels, repositories or contribution mechanisms.

## 2. Service Use and Rules
**2.1** Pancake is provided primarily as a free service. Feature availability may change over time.  
**2.2** Use of Pancake must comply with Discord's Terms of Service, community guidelines and all applicable laws. You are responsible for ensuring your server's use of Pancake complies with such obligations.  
**2.3** You may not use Pancake for illegal activities, coordinated abuse (e.g., raids, DDoS coordination), harassment, unsolicited mass messaging, or any conduct that violates platform rules or law.

## 3. User Responsibilities
**3.1** Server owners and administrators are solely responsible for Pancake's configuration and commands executed in their servers. Actions taken by Pancake under administrative commands or automation are the responsibility of the server administrators who configured those actions.  
**3.2** You must not provide Pancake with data that you do not have the right to share (e.g., copyrighted media without permission, private personal data of others without consent).  
**3.3** If you enable third-party plugins, you accept the risk associated with those plugins and agree that Plugin Authors are responsible for their plugin code.

## 4. Plugins and Third-Party Code
**4.1** Plugins may be developed and distributed by Plugin Authors. Plugin Authors retain ownership of their plugin code unless they explicitly assign rights in writing.  
**4.2** Pancake Development Team may review, list, or integrate plugins into official channels, but such listing or review does not constitute a warranty of safety, security or suitability.  
**4.3** Plugin Authors are responsible for maintaining their plugins and addressing security issues. The Pancake Development Team may remove or disable plugins from official distributions for security or compatibility reasons.

## 5. Data, Privacy & Processing
**5.1** Pancake collects and processes certain data necessary to provide functionality (see the Privacy Policy). By using Pancake you consent to collection and processing of such data as described in the Privacy Policy.  
**5.2** If you are a server administrator, you should disclose to your server members which bot features and plugins are enabled and how relevant data will be used.

## 6. Availability, Maintenance and Changes
**6.1** Pancake is provided "as is" and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.  
**6.2** The Pancake Development Team may perform maintenance, updates or emergency actions required for security or stability.  
**6.3** New paid services or premium features (if offered) will be communicated clearly and will not be required for core protections unless explicitly stated.

## 7. Security, Vulnerabilities and Notification
**7.1** The Pancake Development Team endeavors to operate securely and to respond to reported vulnerabilities promptly. If you discover a security vulnerability you should report it to pancakebot.team@gmail.com with a clear description and reproduction steps; do not publicly disclose details until the team has had a reasonable opportunity to respond.  
**7.2** The Team will make reasonable efforts to acknowledge reports and, where appropriate, to coordinate mitigation and disclosure. Reasonable notification timelines will depend on the severity and reproducibility of the issue.

## 8. Abandonment, Transfer of Control and Team Membership
**8.1** Pancake Development Team is the operational entity responsible for running, maintaining and enforcing these Terms for the Service. Authority and responsibility reside with the Team as recorded in project governance.  
**8.2** An Authorized Team Member's responsibilities and authority extend only while that person is formally recognized in team governance. When a member is formally removed or resigns and the change is recorded, that person's authority terminates upon the effective governance record.  
**8.3** If the project is to be discontinued or a member leaves, the Team will attempt to follow responsible decommissioning or transfer procedures. Responsible procedures include: notification to the community, revocation or rotation of credentials and API keys, transfer of repository ownership or designated maintainer roles, and either shut down of running instances or formal transfer of operational control to an identified party.  
**8.4** If an individual departs the Pancake Development Team but the Service (or instances of the Service) remain operational under the control of the Pancake Development Team or other authorized parties, the departing individual is not responsible for Service operation or security that occurs after the formal removal, provided governance records and credential transfers demonstrate that control was transferred.  
**8.5** Leaving a personal role without executing responsible transfer steps while retaining practical control (for example by leaving long-running credentials active and not publishing transfer) may be considered negligent. The Team and maintainers should ensure that governance and transfer actions are documented to avoid ambiguity.

## 9. Termination and Remedies
**9.1** The Pancake Development Team may suspend, restrict or terminate access to the Service for any User or Server that violates these Terms.  
**9.2** Termination of access does not limit the Team's right to pursue any other remedies available by law for breach, including enforcement actions described in Section 11.

## 10. Limitation of Liability and Warranty Disclaimers
**10.1** THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". THE PANCAKE DEVELOPMENT TEAM DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  
**10.2** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER THE PANCAKE DEVELOPMENT TEAM NOR PLUGIN AUTHORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
**10.3** DISCLAIMER OR LIMITATION ABOVE DOES NOT APPLY WHERE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

## 11. Enforcement and Legal Remedies
**11.1** The Pancake Development Team and Plugin Authors reserve the right to enforce these Terms and protect their intellectual property, including but not limited to issuing takedown notices, reporting violations to platform providers (Discord Trust & Safety, GitHub, hosting providers), and pursuing legal remedies.  
**11.2** Any enforcement pursued by an Authorized Team Member on behalf of the Pancake Development Team will be considered enforcement by the Team; individual Plugin Authors retain independent enforcement rights over their own code.

## 12. Changes to Terms
**12.1** The Pancake Development Team may update these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms will be published in the official repository and will include a revised Effective Date. Continued use of Pancake following publication constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
**13.1** These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Pancake Development Team operates for enforcement purposes, subject to mandatory provisions of applicable laws in other jurisdictions. Parties should attempt to resolve disputes amicably prior to initiating formal legal action.
